This is a file to which I can add a character and then `git push`, to
trigger rebuilding/publishing of an image on GHCR. I need *something*
like this, because upstream changes to the packages in my GitHub drat
repository do not trigger rebuilds of the image that needs to contain
them.

Dates of rebuilds:
- 2022-06-02
